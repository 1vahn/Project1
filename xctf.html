    <h1>Cross Country and Track & Field</h1>
    <p>A common misconception is that cross country and track are similar sports. They are not. Let's break down the differences.</p>
    <h2>Cross Country</h2>

    <p>This is the sport you sign up for when you realize that your life calling is to wake up at 4 am every Saturday to go run in the woods. People can say that they like this sport, but usually they're lying.</p>

    <h2>Track & Field</h2>

    <p>While you're still running in track, the difference is that track is a little less miserable. Just a little less. And also you're running on a flat rubber oval instead of up a muddy 60 degree hill.</p>
